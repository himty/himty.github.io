## COMMAND PROMPT
===============

`pwd`
- get your directory

`cd`
- go to that directory (follow pwd's format)



## SETUP
=======

`git config`
- --global
    - change setting on all repos
    - disclusion = only change setting on this repo
- --help
    - get local help page
- user.name ["name"]
    - get/set username
        - (put "name" after if you want to set it)
- user.email ["email"]
    - get/set email
- core.editor ["directory"]
    - get/set default editor to type values in when prompted
    - ex: core.editor "atom --wait"

`git init`
- creates new git repository
    - first cd to the correct folder
    - if you want to see it, go to file manager, options,
        show hidden files (roughly)



## DOING STUFF
============

`git status`
- shows status of all files in repo
- untracked- hasn't been anywhere yet
- unmodified- unchanged from last commit/ from after pulling
- modified- changed, but not set to commit yet
- staged- going to commit soon

`git add <filename> [<filename> <filename> ...]`
- add file's content to next commit
    - -start TRACKING that file, STAGE files, mark
        - merge-conflicted files as RESOLVED, etc
- see names of untracked files w/ git status
- ex: git add README
- -s
    - makes output shorter
    - M = modified
    - A = added
    - ?? = not tracked
    - 2 columns of symbols ^^
        - left = staging area status
        - right = working area status
`git commit`
- commits the changes in staging area (see git status)
- w/o -m 
    - opens core editor to type message describing commit
    - close core editor window to proceed
- -m <message>
    - type commit message w/o opening core editor
- -a 
    - commit everything that was changed (skip staging area)

`cat .gitignore <press enter> <what to ignore> <enter> <etc>`
- make those files not show up in git status
- <what to ignore>
    - *.[extension] - ignore w/ that extension
    - *[part of name] - ignore w/ that in end of name
    - (note the * in front)
    - disregards lines with # (comment)
- no .a files
    - *.a
- but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
    - !lib.a
- only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
    - /TODO
- ignore all files in the build/ directory
    - build/
- ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
    - doc/*.txt
- ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory
    - doc/**/*.pdf

`git diff <filename>`
- shows difference between working directory and staging area
    - ex: lines of code that were changed
- <filename> if discluded, shows all files i think
    
`git log`
- gives list of commits w/ their message

`git show <commit>`
- display what changed in that commit (git log?)
- <commit> can be HEAD => the commit you're currently on
    
`git checkout <commit> <filename>`
- restore that file in working directory to that commit's version
    
`git help <commandName>`
- your friend. opens up local help page (html file)
