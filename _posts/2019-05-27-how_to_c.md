## Popular things to include:
============================

`#include <stdio.h>`
- standard input and output

`#include <string.h>`
- strings

`#include <stdlib.h>`
- `exit()` to exit out of code
- `rand()` to create random numbers

`#include <stdbool.h>`
- booleans
- can use bool instead of` _Bool`

`#include <ctype.h>`
- `getchar()` recieves a string/char, can be put in variable
- `putchar(string)` display the char
- `isalnum(char)` and others (see below)
- has an alphanumber been passed in? (a for 10, b for 11, etc)

`#include <errno.h>`
- error handling

`#include <math.h>`
- calculate power of something




## Define:
==========

`#define MYNAME "Derek Banas"`
- all uppercase, a constant

`#undef MYNAME`
- can redefine afterwards




## Concepts and Strategies:
==========================

- main looks like `int main(){}` and returns a `0` at the end

- `&` is to get the pointer, `*` is for the value
    - inverses

- Print things on the screen from an array:
```
char *randomString = "Just some random stuff";
while (*randomString){ //null=>0=>ends while    
    putchar(*randomString++); //increment to chars
}
//OR
int i = 0;
while(randomString[i] != '\0'){
    putchar(randomString[i++]);
}
```

- if you initialize a, but don't give it a value before incrementing it, computer will take whatever was inside the place a is, increment it, and spit it out.  "Random garbage"

- arrays use row-major ordering, so it is array[y][x]




## Data Types:
=============

```
char firstLetter = 'L';
int age = 38; //up to 32000
long int superBigNum = -3229384234; //bigger
float piValue = 3.14; //decimals (38 decimal #s)
double reallyBigPi = 3.1423842323i4uy23i4;
```




## To describe variables:
=========================

`unsigned` = no negative digits

`const` = constant, unchanging

`size_t` = stores the amount of data in bytes

`extern` = variable was defined elsewhere, but use that var here, too

`static` = basically a "global" variable with a scope limited to where it was defined
    - functions: "you can't call me out of my scope! >:D"




## Relational:
=============

`TRUE` is anything other than 0
- can an int be used in if(int) ?

`FALSE` is also 0

`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`

- result comes out as 1 (true) and 0 (false)

- `!0` equals `1`

- `!1` equals `0`

- To choose between two options:

        char* legalAge = (custAge > 21) ? "true" : "false";

    - if true, return true.  If false, return false
    - can be put inside the %s part of printf()






## Casting a value:
==================

- to temporarily change the type

        //when the two numbers are ints:
        printf("numberEx / numberEx2 : %f", (float)numberEx/numberEx2);




## Strings:
===========

- If made by char ex[] = {'C', 'a', '\0'}, include '\0' "naw" to end the string
- or do char myName[] = "Something" (automagically puts \0)
- see Functions




## Pointers:
============
- To pass data to other functions so they can use that local variable as well

- can be in %p and %d (hexidecimal or not)

- `*` to get what's in the pointer
- `&` to make it into a pointer

- print the first index in an array:
```
printf("First: %d", *array);
```

- print any other index because they are next to each other:
```
printf("Thrid: %d", *(array + 2));
```




## Structs:
===========

- more than one data type to describe something
- need `*` for strings because of pointers

- Example:
    ```
    struct dogs{

        const char *name;
        int height; 

    };
    ```

- use `typedef struct` to make it so you don't have to put struct everywhere else
    - "Make a new variable type"

    - Example:
        ```
            typedef struct dog{

                const char *name;
                int height; 

            } dog; //you can call it with dog
                    //can put multiple names
        ```

- To put info in:

    ```
    struct dog spike = {"Spike", 90};
    ```

- To get the info in the struct:
    ```
    theName = theDog.name; //use the . OR
    theName = theDog->name; //OR
    theDog->name = theName;
    ```

- To get addresses, use theDog.name for strings and
    ```
    &theDog.avgHeight for ints
    ```

- When struct is passed to function, new struct is created, so need pointers
- When doing `*` with structs, use `()`: 
    ```
    (*theDog).weight = newWeight;
    ```

    - OR you can do 
        ```
        *theDog->weight = newWeight;
        ```

`struct dog cujo2 = cujo;`
- Can copy everything in a struct, including pointers




## Union:
========

- store 1 pieces of data that can be any type, but is not more than one type at a single time

- Making one:
    ```
    typedef union{
        
        short individual;
        float pound;
        float ounce;

    } amount; //this union is named amount

    //set amount as 16, other values follow
    amount orangeAmt = {.ounce = 16};

    //changes the value of the whole union
    orangeAmt.individual = 4;
    ```

- BE SURE TO USE THE CORRECT DATA TYPE

- Can put them in structs
- To initialize:
    - Ex: orangeProduct is a type of struct named orangeProduct, theAmount is an union, so
        ```
        orangeProduct productOrdered = {"Chiquita",
            .theAmount.ounce = 16};
        ```




## Linked List:
==============

- Essentially make an infinitely long list with structs

- Format of each struct:

    ```
    typedef struct product{

        const char *name;
        float price;

        struct product *next; //pointer to next struct

    } product;
    ```

- if `pProduct` is the pointer of the given product, the next one in the line is `pProduct->next`

- Add a new struct to the end:
    ```
    tomato.next = &potato;
    ```

- add a new product, apple, between potato and lemon:

    ```
    potato.next = &apple, apple.next = &lemon, lemon.next = NULL
    ```

- To go through all structs:
    - go through all the items through next until you get NULL

- To search for a struct:
    - recieve a `*productName`
    - set a varialbe to the first variable in the struct => name
    - use strcmp() to compare

- Deleting an item:
    - Ex: Tomato, Potato, Lemon
    - see what's before potato from the time you were scanning for potato
        - potato's next is now tomato's next
    - free() potato



## Macros:
==========

- A fragment of code that is given a name
- name is read => whole code is pasted in
- conventional = names are all UPPERCASE
- Ex: `#define MACRO_THINGIE 10` -> 10 is put in MACRO_THINGIE, replaces it

- can make multiple lines
    ```
    #define MACRO_NUMBERS 10 \
                            2 \
                            3
    int x[] = {MACRO_NUMBERS};
    ```
    - makes: int x[] = {10,2,3};
    - weird error line numbers later on tho




### Enumerated type
====================
For the times that you don't need anything else other than what you put inside

## Initialize:
==============

`typedef enum{ INDIV, OUNCE, POUND } quantity;`

To set the value:
`quantity quantityType = INDIV;`

To do somethign:

```
if (quantityType == INDIV){
    blah blah
}
```




## Line buffering:
=================

storing/scanning an amount of information before something is done to it




## File I/O:
===========

- Print out data from the file:
    ```
    char buffer[1000];
    while(fgets(buffer, 1000, pFile) != NULL){
        printf("%s", buffer);
    }
    //OR
    while(fscanf(pFile, "%s", buffer) == 1) 
    ```
    - returns # other than 1 if it doesn't pass a string

- Print directly to the file:
    ```
    fputs("Messing with strings", pFile);
    ```
    - pFile is the way you are entering stuff 

- TO PRINT WHOLE THING, YOUR "CURSOR" HAS TO BE AT BEGINNING

- To get number of bytes in whole file:
    ```
    fseek(pFile, 0, SEEK_END);
    ftell(pFile)
    ```
    - because the "cursor" is at the end of the file

- see Functions




## Convert any base to any base:
===============================

For `startingBase`, `endingBase`, `numberToConvert`
- `numberToConvert % endingBase` => put in array
- Then `numberToConvert = (numberToConvert - <remainder>) / endingBase`
    - and so on until you get an error with 1

Convert any base to base 10:
- ex: binary 110 to base 10
    - (1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0)

chars have values, too!
```
if(isalpha(number[i])){
    int charCode = ((int)tolower(number[i])) - 87;
    result += charCode * pow(baseFrom, toThePowerOf);
}
```




## Bitwise operators:
====================

`&` And bitwise operator:
- `110 & 111` => 1 for every time they're both 1
    - 110 is result

`|` Or bitwise operator:
- `6 | 7` => if either is a 1, return a 1 => 111

`^` exclusive or:
- 6 ^ 7
    - 1 returned if one is a 1, other is 0
    - 001 => 1 is returned

`~` bitwise not:
- ~x
    - if a bit in x == 0, that bit is now = 1
    - if a bit in x == 1, that bit is now = 0

- negative is the 2's complement
000000010 => 2
111111101 => complement of 2
111111110 => add 1 to it

- inverse sign = `~`
    - Ex: `~numberSix = -6`

- shift operators:
    - `shiftLeftTwo = numberSix << 2;`
    - `x/pow(2, n)` is the same as `x>>n`

- bit masking
    - if you want to see what is in some specific spots
    - do 1 for parts you want to see, 0 for others
    - do an AND bitwise operator





## Functions:
============

`printf("string, int %d, long int %ld, decimal with 2 decimal `
- places shown %.2f", intValue, longIntValue, floatValue);
- Displays to terminal
- Conversion characters:
    - `%ld` //long
    - `%d` //int
    - `%.5f` //prints to 5 decimal places
    - `%.15f` //used for float and double
    - `%c` //char
    - `%s` //string
    - `%p` //return hexidecimal addresses
        //also use & => printf("%p", &rand1)
- `\n` = line, `\t` = tab, `\\` = print, `\"` = print "



`scanf("<data type in format>", &whereToStore, &otherPlace);`
- Ex: `scanf(" %d/%d/%d", &month, &day, &year);`
- Store input from user, bulky
- will overwrite values if there is a data overflow
- needs the &
- don't use %d++ in the "" because it screws up
- will return a 1 or 0 if compared with == to a number

`fgets(storeHere, 30, stdin);`
- like `scanf()`
- store the 30 bytes of information in storeHere through stdin
- adds the \0 character
- adds new line
- accepts more than one string

`fputs("string here", stdout);`
- string, output method
- no new line

`gets(name);`
- accepts one string and puts it in name
- no new line.  It ends with \0

`puts("string here");`
- makes a new line after displaying the string

`strcpy(myName, "Bob Joe"); //used to hold "Derek Banas"`
- assign a different value to the variable

`strcomp()`
- returns negative # if first string is less than 2nd
- returns positive # if more (second would come first if  alphabetic)
- returns 0 if equal

`strcat(yourCity, yourState);`
- combine the two strings into yourCity

`strlcpy(yourCity, "aksjdfl", sizeof(yourCity));`
- cuts off the end of the string so variable doesn't overflow

`strlen(name);`
- returns the length of the variable (number of slots)

`theChar = getchar();`
- Takes in chars until enter is pressed

`putchar(theChar);`
- print the char on the screen

`strrchr(randomString, '\n');`
- returns last occurance of \n in randomString

`strchr(randomString, 'a');`
- returns first occurance of a in randomString

`tolower(char)`
- makes the letter lower cased
- Ex: `theString[i] = tolower(theString[i]);`

`toupper(char)`
- makes the letter upper cased

`isalnum(char)`
- is it consisting of all numbers?

`isalpha(char)`
- alphabetic character

`isblank(char)`
- space

`isdigit(char)`
- digit

`isgraph(char)`
- anything but space

`isupper(char)`
- upper cased

`islower(char)`
- lower cased

`ispunct(char)`
- punctuation

`isspace(char)`
- any space

`strcmp(string, string)`
- comparing two string sto see if they match
- returns 0 if they're the same
- returns (+) if first string more (further in alpha order)
- returns (-) if first string is less

`exit()`
- Close program.  Don't run anything else.
- can be (0),(1),(2),(3),(4), etc for personal reference

`rand()`
- Create random number
- To get numbers 1-50: `rand() % 50 + 1`

`break;`
- exit out of an infinite loop (is like exit())
- used in switch

`continue;`
- go back to the beginning of the braces
- Ex: 
    ```
    for(blah){ 
        //do something, start here again!
        if (variable == 1){ continue; }
        //don't do this stuff this time
    } 
    ```


```
switch(whatToDo){
        
    case(1) : printf("Print the time");
        break;

    default : printf("Bye");
        exit(0);
        break;

    }
```
- if whatToDo == 1 (in case(1)), do that
- go on to other cases
- default is done if nothing else works
- if there isn't a break, it will execute all the other statements after the one it entered in on range is 4...6 instead of 4 or something

`sizeof(variableName);`
- returns the number of bytes in there

`pRandomNumbers = malloc(amountOfBytesToStore);`
- if fails, stores a NULL
- Good usage to store a specific number of ints:
    - `malloc(amtOfNumbersToStore * sizeof(int))`

`free(pRandomNumbers);`
- free memory for pRandomNumbers to prevent crashing
- used for large scale programs that don't end in a while

`pFile* = fopen("fileName.txt", "w");`
- will make the file if it doesn't exist
- binary files (.bin) use things like rb+
    - "w" - stuff already inside will be deleted/replaced
    - "a" - append or add new info
    - "r" - read from the file
    - "a+" - start at end of file if it exists and reads and writes
    - "r+" - open at beginning for reading and writing, no delete, no make new file
    - "w+" - delete original (or make new one if no exist), read and write
- if file wasn't opened, returns a 1

`fprintf(pFile, "%d", randomNumber)`
- print it to the file like printf()
- file to print to, what to print

`fclose(pFile)`
- close the file, if not closed, returns 0
- if went well, returns 1
    ```
    if(fclose(pFile)) != 0){
        printf("Success writing to text");
    }
    ```

`fseek(pFile, 12, SEEK_SET);`
- can use (-) numbers in fseek()
- 12- move 12 characters => "moving the cursor"
- Seek things:
    - SEEK_SET - Start from beginning of file
    - SEEK_CUR - Move from current position in file
    - SEEK_END - Based off of end of file
- in binary mode, need to * number chars to move by the size of each thingie => move 12 => 12 * sizeof(int)

`ftell(pFilfe)`
- returns the number of bytes the cursor is from the beginning of the file

`perror("Error Occured");`
- prints that and the standard error message

`printf("Error Code %d\n", errno);`
- prints error code

`fwrite(name, sizeof(name[0]), sizeof(name)/sizeof(name[0]), pFile);`
- Write binary data to file
- pointer by default
- variable, size of each element, number of elements, where to print

`fread(buffer, 1, fileSize, pFile);`
- `dataInFile = fread(blah blah);`
- information goes to buffer, bytes taken from each element,
    - number of elements, read from this place

`rewind(pFile);`
- go to beginning of file

`pow(base, toThePowerOf);`
- mutiply base and itself toThePowerOf times
